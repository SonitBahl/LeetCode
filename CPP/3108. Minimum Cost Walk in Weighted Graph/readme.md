# Minimum Cost of a Walk in a Graph

## Problem Statement
There is an **undirected weighted graph** with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `u_i` and `v_i` with a weight of `w_i`.

A **walk** on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. **A walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.**

The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the **bitwise AND** of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `[w_0, w_1, w_2, ..., w_k]`, then the cost is calculated as:

```
w_0 & w_1 & w_2 & ... & w_k
```
where `&` denotes the **bitwise AND** operator.

You are also given a **2D array** `query`, where `query[i] = [s_i, t_i]`. For each query, you need to find the **minimum cost** of the walk starting at vertex `s_i` and ending at vertex `t_i`. If there exists no such walk, return `-1`.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query `i`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```python
n = 5 
edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]] 
query = [[0,3],[3,4]]
```
#### Output:
```python
[1, -1]
```
#### Explanation:
- To achieve the cost of `1` in the first query, we take the path:
  - `0 -> 1` (weight `7`), `1 -> 2` (weight `1`), `2 -> 1` (weight `1`), `1 -> 3` (weight `7`).
- In the second query, there is **no walk** between nodes `3` and `4`, so the answer is `-1`.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```python
n = 3 
edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]] 
query = [[1,2]]
```
#### Output:
```python
[0]
```
#### Explanation:
- To achieve the cost of `0` in the first query, we take the path:
  - `1 -> 2` (weight `1`), `2 -> 1` (weight `6`), `1 -> 2` (weight `1`).
