## 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

**Note that:**
- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
- The answer and all intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
 tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
 9
```
**Explanation:**
```
((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
 tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
 6
```
**Explanation:**
```
(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```plaintext
 tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
 22
```
**Explanation:**
```
((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.
